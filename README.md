IOCipher Example
================

This is an example app for the IOCipher framework, which provides encrypted
virtual disks for Android.  This app aims to show the most basic working
examples of how to use IOCipher for learning the basics.  It does not show
best practices for things like password management.

IOCipher was designed to be used with the CacheWord library for password/key
management:
